# SML_Project1
Statistical Machine Learning COMP90051 Project 1 - Semester 2

Currently progressing through SML - using python jupyter notebook.

v 0.1 - Currently adding features as additional columns for testing. Data is pre-processed via a number of methods.
        Yet to work with a SML model.

v 0.2 - Tested various models including decision trees, random forests, SVM, NB, etc... Until fastText was used

v 0.3 - varied and subsampled with fasttext. Only preprocessed the data, no feature extraction.

v 1.0 - achieved 19% classification with fasttext (epoch 30, dimension 100, learning rate 0.5, loss function softmax)
